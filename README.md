# Egg case

It is often not possible to get a proper whiskey sour, because bars do not have eggs. This case enables one to safely transport a single egg to a bar. Print two, fit them together, and put a band around the recessed area around.

Compile with OpenSCAD and print with your favourite slicer and printer. I found I could get away with a support angle of 70 degrees. Lower print temperatures seem to work better. YMMV.
